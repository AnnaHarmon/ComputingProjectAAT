#computing 2 Project Progress Report
#April 17, 2020

#Partners: Anna Harmon, Ashley Huebert, and Tori Schooler 

#Goal: Use python to analyze images by measuring E.coli growth
#taken from Anna Harmon's capstone project. Use t.test to to analyze growth
#at different developmental stages. Use .plot function to graphically 
#show results. 

TO DO: 

Tori 
#importing python packages necessary to analyze images. Including 
"opencv" "numpy" "scipy" "sckikit" "PIL" 
#use "imutils" package in order to measure E.coli in images.
#plot data using .plot with R

Anna 
#import images into computingprojectAAT.Rmd to be analyzed and gather measurement data. 

Ashley 
#perform t.test on size of E.coli in different developmental stages
